# HTML-CSS-miniproject1-landingpage
This project is a mini website built using HTML and CSS. It includes a login page where users can enter their username, email, and password, along with a link for forgot password. After clicking the login button, it navigates to the main landing page. The landing page features a brief introduction to the platform, as well as buttons like “Project+”, “Demo Video,” and “Login” with hover effects. The focus of the project is on creating a clean and visually appealing design for both pages.
